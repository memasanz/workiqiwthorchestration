# multipersonworkflow

Multi-person, multi-agent workflow on Azure AI Foundry. Three registered
Foundry agents (submissions / tax / legal) hand off through a custom
group-chat orchestrator (`chat-api`), with a React SPA front-end
(`chat-ui`), Cosmos DB for project + assignment state, and three MCP
backends that expose workflow tools per role profile.

```
chat-ui (React/Vite SPA)
   │  Authorization: Bearer <user JWT for api://mpwflow-api/Chat.ReadWrite>
   ▼
chat-api (FastAPI, Python)
   │  validates JWT (PyJWT) → builds OnBehalfOfCredential per request
   │  via Federated Identity Credential (UAMI signs assertion → no secret)
   ▼
Azure AI Foundry  ← runs registered agents as the signed-in user
   ├─ submissions / tax / legal agents (FoundryAgent participants)
   ├─ workflow MCP (Cosmos-backed) — open today; per-role profile filter
   └─ WorkIQ MCP (Microsoft 365 User Profile) — ARA OBOs the user token
```

## Deploy from zero

Two M365 portal prereqs (manual, admin-only) + **one command** for everything else.

### 0. Tools

Install once, then sign in to **both** CLIs (azd and az use separate
token caches):

```pwsh
winget install Microsoft.AzureCLI
winget install Microsoft.Azd                  # Azure Developer CLI
winget install Microsoft.PowerShell           # PowerShell 7+
winget install Astral-sh.uv                   # for local Python work
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS              # for local chat-ui work

az login                                      # required for `az` calls in hooks
azd auth login                                # required for `azd up` / env
```

> Both logins are **mandatory** — the deploy wrapper uses `az` (for
> `az ad`, `az containerapp`, `az cosmosdb`) **and** `azd` (for
> provisioning + env management). Run them in the same terminal you'll
> run `deploy.ps1` from. Re-run them if you see `AADSTS70043`
> (token expired) or any `unauthorized` errors mid-deploy.

### 0.5. Required permissions

The deploy wrapper performs three categories of admin actions. The
identity running `pwsh ./scripts/deploy.ps1` needs all of the following
in the target tenant + subscription:

| Action | Done by | Minimum role(s) needed |
|--------|---------|-----------------------|
| Create / update Entra app registrations + add federated credential | `setup-entra.ps1` | **Application Administrator** *or* **Cloud Application Administrator** (Entra) |
| Grant tenant-wide admin consent on 4 delegated permissions (incl. admin-only `user_impersonation` + `McpServers.Me.All`) | `grant-consent.ps1` | **Privileged Role Administrator** *or* **Global Administrator** (Entra) |
| Provision Azure resources (Cosmos, ACR, Container Apps, UAMI) + create RBAC role assignments | `azd up` (Bicep) | **Contributor** *and* **User Access Administrator** (or just **Owner**) on the resource group / subscription |
| Cosmos DB data-plane role assignment for the deploying user | Bicep `adminCosmosRbac` (auto) | covered by the Owner / UAA role above |
| Add WorkIQ catalog connections in Foundry | manual step 1 | **Foundry project Owner** in the Microsoft 365 / Foundry portal |

In practice, a tenant **Global Administrator** with **Owner** on the
target subscription has everything. If you split duties, you need both
an Entra admin (for `setup-entra.ps1` + `grant-consent.ps1`) and an
Azure admin (for `azd up`) to run the wrapper end-to-end.

> **Tip:** if you don't have Application Administrator, you can ask
> your tenant admin to pre-create the two app regs and skip step 3.1
> in `deploy.ps1` (run only the second pass with the existing IDs in
> `.env`).

### 1. Admin: Foundry portal prereqs (one-time, manual)

`azd` cannot provision the Foundry project or WorkIQ catalog
connections — these are M365 portal actions.

In the target tenant:

1. Create / pick an **Azure AI Foundry** project.
2. Deploy a chat model (e.g. `gpt-4o-mini`) and note the deployment name.
3. Add two WorkIQ catalog MCP connections (*Project → Connections →
   + New connection → Microsoft Agent 365*):
   - **`WorkIQUser`** → `https://agent365.svc.cloud.microsoft/agents/servers/mcp_MeServer`
   - **`WorkIQMail`** → `https://agent365.svc.cloud.microsoft/agents/servers/mcp_MailTools`

   The names **must** match exactly — `agents/{tax,legal}/create_agent.py`
   look them up by name.

### 2. Developer: configure `.env`

```pwsh
cp .env.sample .env
# Fill in:
#   AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
#   AZURE_BASE_NAME            (3-12 chars, lowercase alphanumeric)
#   AZURE_ENV_NAME             (e.g. <base>-dev)
#   AZURE_LOCATION             (e.g. eastus2)
#   FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT
#   FOUNDRY_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME
# (ENTRA_TENANT_ID / ENTRA_BACKEND_APP_ID / ENTRA_SPA_APP_ID are
#  filled in automatically by step 3 — leave blank on first run.)
```

### 3. One-shot deploy

```pwsh
pwsh ./scripts/deploy.ps1
```

This wrapper does everything, idempotently:

1. **Entra app regs (first pass)** — `setup-entra.ps1` creates the
   `<base>-api` and `<base>-spa` registrations and writes their IDs back
   into `.env`.
2. **`azd up`** — provisions Bicep + builds + deploys + runs four hooks:
   - **preprovision** (`scripts/pre-provision/load_env_and_admin.ps1`):
     loads `.env` into the azd env and captures your user objectId so
     bicep can grant *you* Cosmos data-plane RBAC for seed scripts.
   - **predeploy** (`scripts/pre-deploy/write_chat_ui_env.ps1`): writes
     `chat-ui/.env.production` so Vite inlines real MSAL `tenantId` /
     `clientId` into the JS bundle (otherwise sign-in fails with
     `AADSTS900144`).
   - **postprovision** (`scripts/post-provision/register_agents.ps1`):
     registers / updates the 3 Foundry PromptAgents with the MCP FQDNs
     just created.
   - **postdeploy** (`scripts/post-deploy/fanout_mcp_image.ps1`):
     copies the freshly built mcp-server image to the tax + legal
     Container Apps and seeds Cosmos `routing/tax` + `routing/legal`
     queues (via `seed_routing.py`).
3. **Entra app regs (second pass)** — adds the federated credential
   binding the backend app reg to the chat-api UAMI (which now exists)
   plus the production redirect URI on the SPA.
4. **Tenant admin consent** — `grant-consent.ps1`.
5. Opens the deployed chat-ui in your default browser.

> **Why the two passes of `setup-entra.ps1`?** The federated credential
> on the backend app reg trusts the chat-api UAMI by `principalId` —
> which doesn't exist until `azd up` provisions it. The first pass
> creates app regs only; the second adds the FIC + prod redirect URIs.
> Both passes are idempotent and only add what's missing.

> **Edit SME assignees**: by default, `seed_routing.py` populates the
> tax + legal queues with placeholder emails. Open
> `scripts/admin/seed_routing.py` and edit the `ROUTING_DOCS` list to
> use real users in your tenant before the first real test.

### 4. Smoke

The browser should be open. Sign in with a tenant user. Send "Hi" — the
submissions agent should greet you by name (via WorkIQ `GetMyDetails`).
Tax / legal questions are routed to the matching SME agent and answered
as you (OBO).

## Re-deploy a single service

```pwsh
azd deploy chat-api      # or chat-ui, or mcp-server
```

`azd deploy` rebuilds + pushes a new image and updates the matching
Container App. To re-run a hook only, run the script directly:

```pwsh
pwsh ./scripts/pre-provision/load_env_and_admin.ps1   # refresh azd env from .env
pwsh ./scripts/pre-deploy/write_chat_ui_env.ps1       # refresh chat-ui MSAL config
pwsh ./scripts/post-provision/register_agents.ps1     # re-register Foundry agents
pwsh ./scripts/post-deploy/fanout_mcp_image.ps1       # re-fan-out mcp image + reseed routing
python ./scripts/admin/seed_routing.py                # reseed routing only
```

> **Note for `azd deploy <single-service>`:** when targeting a single
> service, some azd versions skip the global `predeploy` hook. If MSAL
> IDs have changed, run `pwsh ./scripts/pre-deploy/write_chat_ui_env.ps1`
> first (or just re-run `pwsh ./scripts/deploy.ps1` — it's idempotent).

> **`BACKEND_BASE_URL` in `chat-ui/Dockerfile`** has a hard-coded default
> URL that's only a placeholder — at runtime nginx reads the real value
> from the Container App env var (set in `infra/modules/chat-ui.bicep`),
> so the default is never actually used.

## Tear down

```pwsh
azd down --purge --force
```

Note: this only removes resources `azd up` created. It does **not**
delete the Foundry project, WorkIQ connections, or Entra app regs —
those are admin-managed prerequisites. Specifically, the federated
identity credential and production redirect URI added by the second
`setup-entra.ps1` pass will remain on the backend / SPA app regs and
need to be cleaned up manually if you want a fully clean slate.

## Iteration plan

See [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md) (or [`PLAN.html`](./PLAN.html) for a rendered
view). Iteration 8 collapsed deploy to a single command
(`scripts/deploy.ps1`) driven by `.env`.

## End-user identity passthrough (OBO + FIC)

When **System Administrator** asks "do I have any open projects?", the
WorkIQ MCP server must see a token *for that user* — not the chat-api's
service identity. Otherwise everyone would see everyone's projects.

### Scopes used at each hop

| Hop | Scope | Asked by | Audience of returned token |
|-----|-------|----------|----------------------------|
| 1. Browser → backend | `api://<backend-app-id>/Chat.ReadWrite` `openid` `profile` `offline_access` | chat-ui (MSAL.js) | backend app reg |
| 2. MI → Entra (assertion) | `api://AzureADTokenExchange/.default` | `OnBehalfOfCredential.client_assertion_func` | special audience used only as a FIC `client_assertion` |
| 3. backend → Foundry (OBO) | `https://ai.azure.com/.default` | `AIProjectClient` via `BearerTokenPolicy` | `https://ai.azure.com` (Foundry data plane) |
| 4. Foundry → WorkIQ (auto-OBO) | `api://<workiq-app-id>/McpServers.Me.All` | Foundry runtime (`UserEntraToken` connection) | WorkIQ MCP app reg |

The `.default` suffix means *"give me every scope that has been
admin-consented for this resource"* (vs. naming individual scopes).
Required for client_credentials, OBO, and managed-identity flows.

### Where each scope is set

- **Hop 1** — `chat-ui/src/auth/msal.ts` `loginRequest.scopes`. The backend
  app reg exposes `Chat.ReadWrite` as a delegated scope.
- **Hop 2** — `chat-api/src/chat_api/foundry_credential.py` — the
  assertion func calls
  `ManagedIdentityCredential().get_token("api://AzureADTokenExchange/.default")`.
  The federated credential on the backend app reg must trust this UAMI's
  `principalId` (NOT its clientId).
- **Hop 3** — **NOT in our code.** Hard-coded inside `azure-ai-projects`
  (`AIProjectClient._config.credential_scopes`). The OBO exchange asks
  Entra for this scope; the backend app reg must have admin-consented
  API permission to *Azure AI Services / user_impersonation* (or
  equivalent) — that's why the user only sees the consent prompt once.
- **Hop 4** — Configured per-tool in the **Foundry agent definition**
  (auth type = `UserEntraToken`, scope = `McpServers.Me.All`). Foundry
  stores the scope and runs the second OBO automatically when invoking
  the MCP connection.

### Glossary

- **UAMI — User-Assigned Managed Identity.** A standalone Entra
  identity you create as an Azure resource and attach to one or more
  consumers (Container Apps, VMs, Functions). Unlike a system-assigned
  MI, a UAMI's `principalId` is **stable across redeploys** of the
  consumer — that's critical here because the backend app reg's
  federated credential trust is bound to that exact `principalId`. We
  create one UAMI for chat-api and one per MCP profile in
  `infra/modules/identity.bicep`.

- **FIC — Federated Identity Credential.** An Entra feature that lets
  one identity (a UAMI here) prove it's allowed to act as another
  identity (the backend app registration) **without a client secret**.
  At request time the chat-api asks its UAMI for a token with audience
  `api://AzureADTokenExchange`, then hands that token to Entra as the
  `client_assertion` parameter in the OBO call. Entra trusts it because
  the FIC on the backend app reg pre-approved tokens signed by exactly
  that UAMI's `principalId`. Result: no client secret to rotate or
  leak; the trust binding is to a specific identity in a specific
  subscription, not a static value.

- **OBO — On-Behalf-Of.** The OAuth 2.0 flow where a service exchanges
  a user's access token for a new token (different audience, same user
  identity). Used here to keep all downstream calls *as the user* —
  Foundry / WorkIQ MCPs only ever see tokens for the actual signed-in
  user, never for chat-api's own identity. `OnBehalfOfCredential` from
  `azure.identity` does the exchange; the FIC supplies the
  `client_assertion` instead of a `client_secret`.

### Why a Federated Identity Credential (FIC) instead of a client secret?

chat-api has no client secret. It proves it's the backend app reg by
minting a FIC assertion: it asks its UAMI for a token with audience
`api://AzureADTokenExchange`, then hands that token to Entra as the
`client_assertion` in the OBO call. The backend app reg has a federated
credential pointing at the UAMI's `principalId` — Entra trusts the
assertion because it's signed by a UAMI that was pre-approved.

Net result: *no service principal can spoof a user, no user token leaves
the trust boundary unencrypted, and there is no client secret to rotate
or leak.*
